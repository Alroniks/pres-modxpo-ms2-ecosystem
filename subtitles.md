# 2 - I am
Who I am? My name is Ivan Klimchuk. I am from Belarus. It's near Russia, but don't. Btw, I had a privilege to present all russian-language community. 

I am work as full stack developer, related to web technologies of course. Met MODX in far 2010, in 2011 started work for local community.

Since Febrary of 2013 I am MODX Ambassador in Belarus, also I had status of MODX Professional.

I love MODX and open source. 

Also I do small business related to develop and store extras and themes for MODX. We are at start, but move step by step. 

And of cource work for local community as MODX Ambassador.

#3 - E-commerce - what is it?

So, let's talk about ecomerse at first. What it is? 

# 4 - Required elements of shop


# 5 - Minishop. First generation.



# 6 - MS2 - Cover

#23 - It's easy?
Technicaly I can say... yeees! But of course, besides creating repository you also shuld manage it. Manage users and their private data, manage authors (check and validate author and their extras), preparing descriptions, screenshots and logos. Of cource, you can deliver it to authors, but if you want provide quality, you shoud control it.


#27 - Contacts
It's absolutlly no problem find me in the Internet, but on screen some my contacts. Twitter as the most fastest way to get touch with me. My developer account on Github, where I share almost all of my code.

Below my website and email. And :) If you anywhere see a pinguin like this, most likely it is I.

#28 - Thanks. Questions

I guess that's all that I want tell you, so, please, ask me. I will try answer.
